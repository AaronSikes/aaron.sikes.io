I'm a web developer in Boston. I build web sites and web apps, because I love it. I've never scaled to millions of users, but I do know how to keep thing simple, clear, and maintainable. 
I believe simplicity is the best extensibility.  
I believe in clear, direct communication.  
I value clear, direct communication.  
I value simplicity.  
I value utility.  
I value kindness.  
I value collaboration.
